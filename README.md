Finding Men/Dude Tool repo

This repo is devoted to work on the Tableau Finding Men Tool (aka Dude Tool). The FY18Q3 workbook is posted on sharepoint (https://www.pepfar.net/OGAC-HQ/icpi/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?RootFolder=%2FOGAC%2DHQ%2Ficpi%2FShared%20Documents%2FClusters%2FFinding%20Men&FolderCTID=0x01200080CC6F83D1766F4D9E3497D4529EC74A&View=%7B94C838B2%2DE166%2D4122%2DB8B4%2D7BEB9E1BC12B%7D&InitialTabId=Ribbon%2EDocument&VisibilityContext=WSSTabPersistence)
It uses the same underlying transformed PSNU x IM dataset as the OHA Tableau Dashboard.
